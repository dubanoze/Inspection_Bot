%\section{Introduction}
%Repeatability and accuracy is essential to PCB manufacturing.  That is why careful inspection %of PCB boards is an integral component of the PCB manufacturing process.  It is also essential %to 3D printing.  As 3D printing technology becomes more common place 

%\paragraph{Outline}
%The remainder of this article is organized as follows.
%Section~\ref{previous work} gives account of previous work.
%Our new and exciting results are described in Section~\ref{results}.
%Finally, Section~\ref{conclusions} gives the conclusions.

%\section{Previous work}\label{previous work}
%A much longer \LaTeXe{} example was written by Gil~\cite{Gil:02}.

%\section{Results}\label{results}
%In this section we describe the results.

%\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
%We worked hard, and achieved very little.
